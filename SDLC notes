======
SDLC 
======

=> SDLC means software development life cycle.

=> SDLC represents the process of software project development from starting to ending.

=> SDLC contains several phases/stages

	1) Requirements Gathering

	2) Requirements Analysis

	3) Design

	4) Development (Coding)

	5) Testing

	6) Deployment

	7) Delivery

	8) Support

=> In SDLC we have several methodologies

	a) Waterfall Model (outdated)
		....
	b) Agile Model (trending)


================
Waterfall Model	
================	

=> It is linear model / Sequential model

=> Work will be completed step by step

=> After one stage completed then only move to next stage

=> It supports only forward direction

=> Requirements fixed & budget fixed

=> Client involment is very less.

=> Client will see project only at the end.

=> If client is not happy with project then money will be wasted and time will be wasted.

##### To overcome challenges of waterfall model, industry is using Agile Model now a days #####

==============
Agile Model
==============

=> Agile is an "iterative approach" to develop and deliver software applications to client.

=> In Agile model (planning + development + testing + deployment ) is a continuos process.

=> Project functionalitiy will be divided into multiple sprints/releases.


Ex: Client has given 100 requirements

	
	Sprint-1 : 25 Requirements (plan + develop + test + deliver + take feedback)

	Sprint-2 : 25 Requirements (plan + develop + test + deliver + take feedback)

	Sprint-3 : 25 Requirements (plan + develop + test + deliver + take feedback)

	Sprint-4 : 25 Requirements (plan + develop + test + deliver + take feedback)	


=> Client feedback is very important/critical is Agile model.

=> Client involvement is also high in agile model.

=> Requirements & Budget is not fixed in Agile.


============
Agile Team
============

1) Product Owner :  Responsible for client deliverables.

		 - What to deliver
		 - When to deliver

2) Scrum Master : Responsible to manage the agile team.

		 - Task assignments
		 - Follow up with team for work status
		 - Team colloboration

3) Tech Lead : Seniour resource in team (technical help for team)

4) Team Members : Developers + Testers + DevOps

Note: Industry standard agile team size is 7 to 10 only.

=> One project can have multiple agile teams also.

=> Every agile team will have one tech lead & one scrum master.

==================
Agile Terminology
==================

1) Backlog Grooming

2) Story & Story Points

3) Sprint Planning

4) Sprint

5) Scrum

6) Retrospective


=> Backlog grooming is a meeting in which we will discuss pending works in the project.

=> For every pending work, one story will be created in jira. All team members can create stories in JIRA Backlog.

=> For every story we will assign story points.

=> Story points represents duration to complete the story.

		1 day => 3 points

		2 days => 5 points

		3 days => 8 points


=> Sprint Planning is a meeting in which we will discuss about priority stories to complete.

Note: Industry standard for sprint duration is 2 weeks of time.

=> Sprint means fixed set of stories targeted to be completed in sprint duration.

=> During sprint, every day scrum call will be there for the team.

=> Scrum call is a meeting in which we will discuss agile team work updates.

			1) What i am doing today (story detail)
			2) When my story will be completed
			3) Any challenges i am facing to complete

Note: Every team member should give above updates to scrum master in scrum call on daily basis.

Note: If you are not available to join scrum then send your work updates to the scrum master in email.

=> Retrospective is a meeting in which agile team will discuss about prevous sprints.

=> Retro is like a review meeting. in retro we will discuss

		- what went well
		- what went wrong
		- lessons learnt
		- new ideas

Note: After every 2 sprints we will have one Retro meeting.
