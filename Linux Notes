=========
Linux OS
=========

=> Where we will use linux os in real-time

=> We will install devops tools in linux machines

	=> Jenkis Server
	=> Docker Server
	=> K8S cluster
	=> SonarQube server
	=> Nexus Server
	=> ELK stack
	=> Grafana & Promethues servers
	=> Ansible server

=> We will install database server software in linux machines

=> Real-Time Applications will be deployed in linux machines only


=============
What is OS ?
=============

=> It is a software which acts as mediator between user and computer.

=> Users will communicate with computers using OS

=> Without OS we can't use any computer

=> OS provides platform to run our applications in computer.

	Ex: notepad, calculator, browser, tomcat....

=> We have several operating systems in market

	Ex: Windows, Linux, Mac, Android, IOS etc...	

===========
Windows OS
===========

=> Developed by Microsoft company (Bill Gates)

=> Windows os is licensed (commercial)

=> Windows is single user based os

=> Security features are less in windows os (anti virus s/w required)

=> Windows is GUI based (graphical user interface)

=> Windows is recommended for personal use

	Ex: watch movies, play games, online classes....

==========
Linux OS
==========

=> Linux is community based os (not specific to any company)

=> Linux is free and open source os

=> Linux is Multi User based OS

=> Linux is highly secured (anti virus is not required)

=> Linux is CLI based os (command line interface)

=> Linux is highly recommended for business use (servers management)

	Ex: App Servers, DB servers, jenkins, docker, k8s, nexus....

==============
Linux History
==============

=> Linux OS developed by "Linus Torvalds"

-> Linus Torvalds identified some challenges/issues in Unix OS

-> Linus Torvalds identified one OS which is matching with his ideas 

			i.e Minux os	

-> Linus Torvalds used Minux OS code and made some changes and released into market as new OS i.e Linux OS.

		(Li) nus + Mi (nux) = Linux

======================
Linux Distributions
======================

-> Linus Torvalds provided Linux OS source code for free of cost

-> So many companies downloaded Linux OS source code and modified according to their requirement and released into market with their brand names

Those are called as Linux Distributions/ Linux Flavours.

-> We have 200+ Linux Distributions in the market.

	Ex: Amazon Linux, Ubuntu, Red HAT, suse, debian, kali, fedora....

=============================
How to setup Linux Machine ?
=============================

Approach-1 : Download and Install Linux OS in our System.

Approach-2 : Use Virtual Box and install Linux os as guest os

Approach-3 : Setup Linux VM in AWS Cloud for free of cost

			 ( t2.micro / t3.micro -> 1 year & monthly 750 hours you can use )

===========================
How to setup linux machine
===========================

1) Install Linux OS directley in our computer (physical machine)

2) Install Linux OS as Guest OS in windows machine using Virtual Box.

3) Take Linux Virtual Machine using Cloud Platform like AWS

===================
Linux Architecture
===================

1) Shell : mediator between users and kernel

		- it will read commands executed by users
		- validate command syntax
		- convert command into kernel understandable format
		- shell will send instructions to kernel for execution

2) Kernel : heart of linux os (very imp)

		- It will recieve instructions from shell
		- kernel will convert command into hardware understandable format
		- It is mediator between shell and hardware 

3) Hardware components : cpu, ram, io 

===================
Linux File System
===================

=> In Linux OS everything will be represented as File only.

=> Root Directory (/) is starting point of linux machine

=> Inside root directory we have several directories like below

/home : It contains users home directories

	/home/ashok : Ashok home directory

	/home/raju : Raju home directory

	/home/ec2-user : ec2-user home directory

/bin : Essentials ready-to-run-program (binaries)	

/boot : static files of boot loader

/dev : device files

/lib : Shared libraries

/etc : host specific configurations

/opt : Optional application software packages

/tmp : Temporary files will be stored here

/usr : user utilities and applications

/mnt : Mounted File system

/media : Removal Media

=================
Linux Commands
=================

whoami : Display logged-in username

pwd : Display present working directory

date : Display current date

cal : Display current month calendar

cal 2030 : Display 2030 calendar

cd : change directory

	cd .. : go one step back from pwd

	cd <dir-name> : Go inside directory

mkdir : Make directory (create folder)	

		mkdir linux
		mkdir aws
		mkdir devops azure gcp

rmdir : remove empty directory (delete)

		rmdir devops

rm -rf <dir> : remove non-empty directory (recursively & forcefully)

		rm -rf devops		

ls : display present working directory content

ls -l : long list the files in alphabetical order

ls -lr : display files in reverse of alphabetical order

ls -lt : display latest files on top

ls -ltr : display old files on top

ls -la : display hidden files

touch : To create empty files in linux

		touch f1.txt
		touch f2.txt f3.txt

rm : to delete file

		rm f1.txt

		rm -rf <dir-name>

mv : For rename and move files & directories

		mv existing-name  new-name

		mv presention-location new-location		

cat :  create new file with data + append data to file + print file data

		# create new file with data
		cat > f1.txt

		# append data to existing file
		cat >> f1.txt

		# print file data from top to bottom
		cat f1.txt

		# print file data with line numbers
		cat -n f1.txt		

tac : To print file data from bottom to top
